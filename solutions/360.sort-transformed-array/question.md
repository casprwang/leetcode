
Given a sorted array of integers nums and integer values a, b and c.  Apply a quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax2 + bx + c to each element x in the array. 

The returned array must be in sorted order.

Expected time complexity: O(n)

Example:

nums = [-4, -2, 2, 4], a = 1, b = 3, c = 5,

Result: [3, 9, 15, 33]

nums = [-4, -2, 2, 4], a = -1, b = 3, c = 5

Result: [-23, -5, 1, 7]
