
Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.



 Example 1:
Input:  k = 3,  n = 7
Output: 

[[1,2,4]]


 Example 2:
Input:  k = 3,  n = 9
Output: 

[[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]
