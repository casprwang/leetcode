Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

Example:
Assume that words = [&quot;practice&quot;, &quot;makes&quot;, &quot;perfect&quot;, &quot;coding&quot;, &quot;makes&quot;].


Input: word1 = &ldquo;coding&rdquo;, word2 = &ldquo;practice&rdquo;
Output: 3



Input: word1 = &quot;makes&quot;, word2 = &quot;coding&quot;
Output: 1


Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.
